# Computer Vision Projects Repository

Welcome to the Computer Vision Projects repository! This repository contains various exciting Python-based computer vision projects that explore the intersection of computer vision and human-computer interaction. Each project is designed to showcase the potential applications of computer vision in real-world scenarios. Below is a brief overview of the projects included in this repository:

## 1. Computer Cursor Control using Hand Gesture

In this project, we leverage computer vision techniques to control the computer cursor using hand gestures. By tracking the movement of the user's hand, we enable intuitive and hands-free control over the cursor, making it easier to interact with the computer.

## 2. Face Mesh Detection

Face mesh detection is a crucial computer vision task that involves identifying facial landmarks. By leveraging pre-trained models, this project can accurately detect facial landmarks, enabling various applications in facial analysis and augmented reality.

## 3. Finger Count Reader

Using computer vision techniques, this project can recognize and count the number of fingers shown by a user's hand. The application of this project extends to gesture-based interactions and virtual reality scenarios.

## 4. Hand Detection

The hand detection project focuses on locating and identifying human hands within an image or video stream. This capability can serve as a foundational step in various hand gesture-based applications.

## 5. PowerPoint Presentation using Hand Gesture

With this project, you can control a PowerPoint presentation using hand gestures. By interpreting specific hand movements, users can navigate slides and interact with their presentations seamlessly.

## 6. Pose Estimation

Pose estimation is a fundamental computer vision task that involves predicting the positions of key body joints in an image or video. This project showcases how pose estimation can be used for activity recognition, gesture tracking, and motion analysis.

## 7. Security Camera

The security cam project utilizes computer vision to create a surveillance system capable of detecting and identifying objects or individuals within its field of view. This project can be used to enhance security and monitoring in various environments.

## 8. Volume Control using Hand Gesture

With this project, you can control the system's volume using hand gestures. By tracking specific hand movements, users can adjust the volume of their devices without physical contact.

## Getting Started

To run any of the projects in this repository, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, install the required dependencies by running the following command:


```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


Each project is located in its respective directory, containing the necessary code and resources. Please follow the instructions provided in each project's README file for detailed information on how to run and use them.
